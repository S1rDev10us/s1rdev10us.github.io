<br/>
This was a small text-based game that a few friends and I made using python.

It was a procedural game that used a specially formatted json file to run game logic. The json file could be easily and freely exchanged to run a different game

The rather odd naming was auto generated by Github. I was planning on changing it at some point but we never came up with a better name and the others in the group wanted the name to stick.

You can access the [documentation](https://github.com/S1rDev10us/Documentation-CuddlyComputingMachine/wiki), [source code](https://github.com/S1rDev10us/Python-CuddlyComputingMachine) and [example game files](https://github.com/S1rDev10us/Python-CuddlyComputingGameData) for free
