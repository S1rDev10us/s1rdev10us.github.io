# My website releases!

### My plans for this website

Since I was fairly young, I have really enjoyed video games. This isn't especially uncommon but that mixed with my passion for coding has for quite a long time made me decide that I want to go into games development.

In preparation for this I decided to make a website for my game development. This took me quite a while but I knew that I needed a central hub for my devlogs and my social media.

On my website I plan to occasionally release written blogs and also to release written versions of my videos and devlogs. Some of these written versions will just be uploads of my scripts and others may have illustrations to match the videos to go with them.

### The history of my website

For several years I have been struggling to create my website. At first I wanted to create it from scratch. I didn't need any frameworks or libraries! As time went on however, I started to realise that this independency was just plain inconvenient.

Finding that plain old HTML, CSS and JS did not fit my needs, I put it off for a while...

#### React

I tried [react](https://reactjs.org/) along with [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and a [bootstrap library](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for a while. The templating and component based aspect worked really well for me however it made my website feel slow at times and was over the top for my essentially static website.

#### Astro

It was at this point that I discovered [astro](https://astro.build/). It fit my needs of creating a static website that reacted to content changes really well AND gave me the templating system that I wanted from react.

Astro was initially quite frustrating simply because the [library I used to use for bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), didn't work for astro even though astro was meant to be mostly plug and play for react. This was quite frustrating and for a while I thought about making my own version.

The [version of this library for astro](https://astro-bootstrap.github.io/) annoyed me because I hadn't actually learned the bootstrap syntax only the react library which was much easier. The astro library relied heavily on that syntax so I decided that not using a library would be much easier since I was having to learn bootstrap anyway.

From this point I started to recreate my website mostly from scratch because of the lack of compatibility of my old code adding features as required until it became the website that I release today!
