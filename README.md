# Welcome to the source code of my website

⚠️ I am not a frontend developer and some of this code is REALLY bad, this code was thrown together over multiple months with lots of gaps in-between so it is structured incredibly badly

### Feel free to have a look at the source code on the main branch

## Setup guide

If you want to run this locally, download the repository then install the dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

You can then run the project with

```powershell
npm run serve
```
